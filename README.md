# Nuxt.js starter project with TailwindCSS in TypeScript
I've created this project with the intention to use it as an entry for static generated sites, but it can be extended for other Nuxt.js uses too.

Starter project containing:
- Nuxt.js with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS

## Install dependencies
```shell
$ yarn install
```

## Starter Scripts

- **dev**: launches Nuxt.js front-end in dev-mode (with hot-reloading)
- **generate**: launches Nuxt.js generate-process
